# Setup macOS with ansible

## Prerequisite

1. Enable ssh on the remote system  
   System Preferences -> General -> Sharing -> Remote Login  
   or  

   ``sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on``

2. Copy ssh pub key to the remote system  

   ``ssh-copy-id user@10.11.12.13``

3. Install Developer Tools (Python3) on the remote system  

   ``xcode-select --install``

## Apply Base configuration

```
ansible-playbook [-i 10.11.12.13, [-u user]] macos.yml [--ask-become-pass]
```

> Mind the comma ',' after the IP address.

> The ``--ask-become-pass`` is only necessary for the installation 
> of homebrew at the very first run.

## Caveats

- In UTM VMs the terminal App _Kitty_ does not work. It needs OpenGL, which is not available in UTM.  
  Use ``terminal`` instead and set the font to _MesloLGM Nerd Font Mono_ in the profiles.
- For the Mac App Store (mas) an Apple-ID is needed. You must be logged in to be able to install Apps.
